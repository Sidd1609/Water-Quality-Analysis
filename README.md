# Water-Quality-Analysis
Using Highly sensitive sensors like turbidity and Ph sensors to understand to effect of ph and temperature. Hence able to predict the quality of the water. Used Arduino as the micro controller and a Wifi module ESP8266 for connecting the arduino to cloud ie Thingspeak for collecting the data from the device. Performing data analytic methods like Time Series Analytics and Streaming Analytics to analyze the current data. This data can further be used to train ML models to perform water treatment automation by using only limited amount of chemicals based on the quality of water. It can also be implemented as a home appliance along with RO to provide the user information about the bacterial content and the quality of the water.
